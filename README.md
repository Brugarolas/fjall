# LSM-tree

A K.I.S.S. implementation of log-structured merge trees (LSM-trees/LSMTs)

This is the most feature-rich and fastest LSM-tree implementation in Rust! It features, among other things:

- Tiered and Levelled (optionally Lazy-Levelled) Compaction
- Partitioned block index to reduce memory footprint
- Block caching to keep hot data in memory
- Bloom filters to avoid expensive disk access for non-existing items
- MONKEY-optimized bloom filter allocation to optimize the memory footprint of bloom filters in regards to the false positive rate
- Sharded log & memtable for concurrent writes
- Atomic batch operations
- Automatic background compaction & tombstone eviction
- 100% safe Rust

## Benchmark

Performance to expect roughly:

- Instantaneous startup, even for 500M+ objects
- ~500k+ writes per second for a single thread
- ??? MB/s throughput
- <1Î¼s reads for hot (cached) data (2M+ reads per second)
- ??? for cold data (??? reads per second)
