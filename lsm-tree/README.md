A K.I.S.S. implementation of log-structured merge trees (LSM-trees/LSMTs) in Rust.

> This crate only provides a primitive LSM-tree, not a full storage engine.
> For example, it does not ship with a write-ahead log.
> You probably want to use https://github.com/marvin-j97/fjall instead.

```bash
cargo add lsm-tree
```

## About

This is the most feature-rich LSM-tree implementation in Rust! It features:

- Thread-safe BTreeMap-like API
- 100% safe & stable Rust
- Block-based tables with LZ4 compression
- Range & prefix searching with forward and reverse iteration
- Size-tiered, (concurrent) Levelled and FIFO compaction 
- Multi-threaded flushing (immutable/sealed memtables)
- Partitioned block index to reduce memory footprint and keep startup time tiny [1]
- Block caching to keep hot data in memory
- Bloom filters to increase point lookup performance (`bloom` feature, enabled by default)
- Snapshots (MVCC)

Keys are limited to 65536 bytes, values are limited to 2^32 bytes. As is normal with any kind of storage
engine, larger keys and values have a bigger performance impact.

## Stable disk format

The disk format will be stable from 1.0.0 (oh, the dreaded 1.0.0...) onwards. Any breaking change after that
will result in a major bump.
